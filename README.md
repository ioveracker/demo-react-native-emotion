# demo-react-native-emotion

A place to try out 👩‍🎤emotion in a React Native project.

## Getting Started

Using node@12 or newer, install dependencies with yarn:

```
yarn
```

Next, install iOS dependencies:

```
cd ios && pod install
```

Or, if you have rbenv installed and configured, you can automate installation of the expected versions of ruby and cocoapods by running `yarn setup:ios`.
